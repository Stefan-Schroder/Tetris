## Game Description ##
It is basically tetris but with some extra mechanics.

1. The walls wrap around and so do the blocks:
    There are "mirror bars" on either side of the block space, that aid the placement of blocks that wrap the screen
    _They are not an extra block space_

2. Yeet buttons:

    Still dont understand? Definition:
    "
        Yeet
        Yeet is a beautiful and commnly misused word. It is very flexible and can take many parts of speech.

        However, it's tenses are often used incorrectly. In the future, you "will yeet," In the present you "are yeeting,"
        and in the past, "you yote."

        "Yote" is often replaced with "yeeted," but that is a prime example of poor grammar. Using "yeeted" instead of "yote"
        would be like saying "eated" instead of "ate." It makes you sound like a baby or a moron.

        "Yeet" as a verb

        1.  to make a violent motion of any variety, such as a "whip," or any motion that may be associated with violent
            camera shake or photo blur.

        2.  "Yeet" is quite commonly used as a verb for the specific purpose of throwing an object forcefully over a long distance.

        3.  "Yeet" can also be used as something you'd include in a sentence to describe what happened to someone who has been
            greatly or suddenly defeated in a competition such as sports or a video game.
        ...

    as said by Pasguine(October 28, 2017) on Urban Dictionary (https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Yeet)

    ANYWAY, basically the asd (not w) will hurl your block in the 3 directions specified by wasd.
    on impact of any other block or the floor the yote block will solidify and the next block created.

3. Rotation Sticking:
    As many great programmers might have said: "it is not a bug, it is a feature". This "mechanic" is mostly due to my lazyness.
    If a rotation is made that would have ended in 2 blocks colliding, or with a block and a surface, instead of having the "kick" feature,
    as seen in any better made versions of tetris, the blocks will meld together and solidify.
    This can be used to make all sorts of interesting patterns (if you can figure out how to do it properly, unlike myself)
